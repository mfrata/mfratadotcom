Have you ever encountered yourself dealing with two or more contexts on your
work at the same time? You were coding the solution from problem A. Your peer
on slack requests your help to access some database to solve problem B. Then
you saw a discussion on a thread on problem C that also relates to problem D.
You follow some of the links posted on the thread, and a hour goes by you
realise that you are not supposed to be doing that. Or even worse, you are
watching a talk about some new tools for scaling on kubernetes even though you
don't use kubernetes. You may have helped you peer, or caught up on the
discussion, reached four different problems of your work "at the same time" but
the sensation of nothing was **really** done kicks in.

I remembered, after the pandemic hitted us really hard (and the shift on our
routines made pretty much everyone crazy), I was feeling this sensation daily!
I was so overwhelmed by the amount of information coming in, that I had to find
a way to better treat my attention. I've tried to block distraction web sites,
decline more meetings or set a fixed work time. These had their a small
positive contributions. But everything change when I reframed I approach my
day, specially working hours.

For almost a year now, I've been using a method to better structure my day.
This had helped me a lot with dealing with these chaos, and I going to share it
with you.

## What

It is heavily based on the time block planner from Cal Newport[^TBP]. Which is
a spin off of one of the main ideas on book "Deep Work"[^DW]. It has three main
concepts:

The first and main one is to **stop working always in "reactive mode"**. Where
you address the tasks that are most demanding at the time. My story that you
read at the introduction (Yes! That was me!), is a great example of a reactive
mode workday. Instead, you want to **switch to intentional mode**, where you
plan your week and your days before actually starting working.

The second one, that is related to the previous one, is the ability **to look
ahead and rethink**. When I used to play football at the age of twelve, my
coach always said:

> Raise your head and look before you make a pass. Because, at every moment of
the game you decide where the match goes. By passing the ball to a teammate
that is surrounded by opponents or to the one that has a chance to score the
goal.

We can steer the direction of day by pausing and seeing if what is left to do
still makes sense to do it. In other words, you plan your day but don't
strictly follow the plan. Remember, the importance is on having intention!

The final concept is to **stop multitasking**. There's a fallacy were people
i think they are able to handle multiple contexts at the same time. However, the
reality is the opposite[^Multi]. You can, and often need to, solve multiple
contexts at the same day, but not at the **same time**. By planning, you set
specific times to deal with each one of these matters.


## How

Now let's dive in on how we can apply these concepts to our day. You can have a
complete understanding of the time block planner by looking here[^1]. Be aware
that I don't follow exactly like that. This is aimed to be used on your
work hours. However, over time, I expanded to my own projects. I'm going to
explain the way that **I do it**. I recommend to use as an inspiration to
create your own. These methods are not ready for use in our case. There's always
some tweaking that needs to be done!


### Tools

Go analog! Seriously! You don't need a computer to do this. You could be using a
app, or other digital tool. But, that's just another opportunity to get
distracted! Also, the pencil and paper makes the habit to stick, since every
day you have to sit and calmly write down what you have to do. It becomes your
daily ritual.

Any simple notebook and pen or pencil will do it. However, since it's something
that you'll do every day I'd buy something with quality and not the cheapest.
You don't need to aim for the higher end, though. Going a little nerdy now: for
instance, I use a medium size (125x200mm) notebook, so it's easy to transport.
Dotted pages that help me on writing straight lines without the need of a
ruler. Somewhat thick page(80g/mÂ²), since I'm a heavy writer. And, a mechanical
pencil with 0.9mm lead. Again, thick, due to the force I put on writing.

### Weeks

On the first day of the week you do a week planning. Here, you mark the current
week number and you list the projects that you are currently active in. Right
below them you list the main goals or tasks that you want to get done by the
end of the week. You don't have to be specific here, just list one or two high
level goals/tasks for each project. Remember to be mindful about it. In my
opinion three should be the maximum number of goals for each project. You want
to list the things that you actually could achieve in this time spawn. If you
are familiar with the "Sprint review" from the Scrum, these would be the sprint
goal. However, here we are giving one(or more) for each project.

But "what is a project?", you may ask! A project is a context of your life that
act upon for a period of time. For example, if you are on school this can be a
project. Work itself, it's another project. If you are studying another
language, this can be a project too. Now, what ff you have different context
inside those projects? You can list them as subprojects. Taking the school
example again, one subproject could be the classes and the other one the
research or extra curricular that you participate. On work, if you act on
hiring and a specific product, these could become two subprojects on your
weekly planning. You decide the granularity of it. On top of that, I recommend
to have an extra project to set tasks that don't fit into the previous ones.
Usually I put here family stuff and other non recurring obligations of the
house.

### Days

Right after your week planning, on the next page, you start the daily plan by
marking the day of week following by the date. On the left side of the page,
you list the hours that you want to have intention! Skipping one line between
each hour. Every line here represents 30 minutes. You could start listing from
the moment that you wake up until you go to sleep. But, I don't recommend that.
It's cognitively demanding to follow a time block plan[^Downtime], and you
would just burnout in the long run. You want to have periods on your day to you
do whatever you want(or need) without planning it. For me around twelve hours
is my maximum, therefore, I plan from right after breakfast up to the last or
event after work. That's usually from 8am to 8pm.

Afterwards you draw the blocks reflecting your events and tasks that you need
to do on that day. I start by the meetings and events that I need to attend.
Then, based on my week planning, and other work tools to track tasks(like
JIRA), I fill the times that I need focus to tackle those. For me I
try to set 90 minutes blocks (3 lines on the page) to these concentration
tasks. For low cognitive or quick ones, you can batch them on to one small
block. For instance, email and caught up on slack plus other quick
administrative work. On these types of batches tasks, you'll see that you don't
have enough room to write on a 30 min block. On that case, you just mark it and
list the tasks on the right upper corner side of the page.

Aside from the events, It's really important also to schedule breaks, buffer
and commuting time. Breaks are really to take, even though they are often
neglected, especially by workaholics. It's funny because sometimes we forget
that we are not robots! Based on the pomodoro technique 30 minutes after 2
hours. But that will vary according to your need. Most of the days I set three
big breaks: one to two hours right around lunch, 30 minutes on the afternoon to
drink a coffee, and another 30 minutes right after work, before my last task to
transition to the night[^Proc]. If I start to work really early like 7am or
8am, I take another break around 10am! Likewise, scheduling buffer and commuting
time is crucial. We forget that between two events or tasks there will be a
transitions be it cognitive, time or of places. So, between two meetings
remember to set a 15 minute time window. When you have to go somewhere include
de commute time on the task block!

/>

As the day progresses you will "notice" that we are really bad at planning!
Certainly you will need to reschedule some tasks or events. That's why we
drawed the blocks on the left side of the page, leaving the middle and right
side clear. When something goes off course, you just redraw (from the current
time) the new plan right next to the previous one. The right side is an extra
column for another replan. I've never needed a fourth column. There's also
unexpected tasks or ideas that pop on your mind during the day. What do to with
those?  Well that depends. Work related, I use the slack reminder feature. For
personal things, I put on the lower part of the page to be addressed later.

You repeat this process every day up to the end of your week. I just do this on
week days, leaving weekends free. The same goes for vacations or sick days. But
as I repeated throughout this essay: you have to adjust to your needs. There will
be work days, though, that you will skip the planning. Those days, where is
total chaos, are the ones where some urgent duty comes up, followed by another
one, and another one, and when you see it's already afternoon and you didn't
plan. Or when your motivation is below zero kelvin, and you just WON'T do it!
And that's ok. Don't go too hard on yourself. On the next sunrise you return to it.
We are aiming for the long term! As I'm checking my notebooks here, throughout this
year, I had two of those days: the first one was because I had an appointment
really early in the morning and I left to do the planning when I'd come back.
However, a bug on production popped right before getting home. That took me the
whole day. Of course, I didn't plan! The other one, a recent one, was a day
that I just looked at the notebook and just thought: "Nop!, Not today". I just
forgot it and worked on reactive mode on that day. Remember: we are not robots!

### An example

The most important part of having intention on your day is the execution. To
illustrate it better, I'm going to come up with a hypothetical situation. Let's
imagine that you are a developer on X company, you are learning French and, you
are a singer in a band (You are really cool!!!). It's week 26 of 2019 (let's
use pre pandemic time :D). You are coding a new feature for a product, you
have a weekly chat with a native french called Adam, a concert scheduled for
next week, and your Mom's birthday on Wednesday.

On monday June 24th, at 8am, you sit down to do your week planning. Ten
minutes after you come with the following:

<Image
  src="/images/54ec2bce78eb4d6c80a06345bc6fb1b0.jpg"
  alt=""
  width={1125}
  height={750}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

Right after that, you do the planning of your Monday. You have attend two
meetings, a run session at night and a singing practice. You come with the
following plan for your monday:

<Image
  src="/images/8d1d802fb24c4c07a33f47b36d5759b4.jpg"
  alt=""
  width={1125}
  height={750}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

Right after planning you do some email and slack to get any updates.
And then, you enter the next big block: code the tests for the feature. You
set aside the notebook, and start working on that. In other words, if you have
to code a test case for your feature, you don't need slack or your inbox
opened, you are not watching a youtube video at the same time, nor with a code
review tab opened. You are coding the tests for your feature! Again to emphasize
a little bit more: YOU ARE CODING THE TESTS CASE FOR YOUR FEATURE. While you
don't finish it or your time block expires, you do nothing else.

It's tempting to think: "oh just a look on this message on slack", or when your
test suit run that takes more than a minute: "let's take a quick look at
twitter". No! As I mentioned earlier context switching does not help you on
accomplishing the task at hand. By being fully present on "coding the tests"
you improve the odds of finishing it with quality and on the time window that
you planned (or even earlier than that). Fail to resist that, and you may have
to reduce the time of your lunch, or maybe attend the meeting 1 divided with
the coding. Or even worse, the tasks lingers to meeting 2, occupying the whole
working day.

This can happen due to bad estimates, but that is not a problem. When this
happens you have to adjust the plan. Let's say that you really worked well on
the morning, but meeting 1 took an extra half an hour. Now it's the time to
rethink. Maybe you can reduce the afternoon break time. Or re evaluate the
necessity of your presence on meeting 2. Since, meeting 1 was long and meeting
2 is important, you decided to keep that break and attend the next meeting. So
you postponed a bit your run session and the following tasks. You come with the
updated daily plan:

<Image
  src="/images/a88eb25edf80467aa1407dbebee6e1da.jpg"
  alt=""
  width={1125}
  height={750}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

As the days progresses, you want to mark the things that are being accomplished.
For instance, on Wednesday 26th, you check that you had a fun chat with Adam on
the day before. On Thursday 27th morning, if you attend the birthday party at
your mom, you check that. On the next monday, July 1st, you sit down again to a
new week planning. Looking at the previous week, you see that you didn't
studied the french past verbs due to an unexpected company event on Thursday. Now
it's time to rethink: Will I have room this week to study it? Isn't better
to postpone to the next week, since you want to focus on the concert that is
coming? Notice that these are all questions. And only you will answer it. You
decide what is more important to do with your time.

## Outcomes

I've been using this for a year now. I don't consider a lot of time. But I've already
seen the benefits. Besides on having intention and concentration on my daily
tasks, I noticed two other outcomes from this habit that is worth mentioning to
you.

The first one is that we start to **face the truth**. The idea is not to
track, but since you are writing the plan of your actions, you can easily
evaluate how much time a given task consumes. When you say that to create a
report takes 30 minutes, but every time you have to increase that time window,
you know that in reality it takes longer! Today, some set of activities from my
job, I already know how much time it will consume. I'm much more accurate on
estimation, my mean error is around 30 minutes.

On top of that, with the week planning you also have bird's eye view off what you
have done! If your company does employee evaluations recurrently, you can start
your self evaluation[^Brag] by looking at your past pages to see what you were
up to. That works for personal projects too. I started to do personal quarterly
reviews on top of that. But that's another story.

The other outcome is the **boost on you "throughput"**. After the first months,
I suspected that I was delivering the tasks much faster than I used to. I
noticed that code reviews from my peers were becoming my bottleneck. At the
beginning I just kept working. I started to use the idle time to fix a
technical debt of the project or to improve the readability on part of the
code or update documentation of the project. Months later, during a round of
feedback, my leader said to me that I was delivery a lot and with quality, He
said: "On every delivery you always add something new, something better." I know
that is anecdotal, but I wasn't doing overtime nor working on weekends.
Actually, looking at my notebook pages here I see that on average I work 7
hours per day, including the 30 min afternoon breaks! My point here is that was
another big fact supporting my hypothesis from months before. This
realization made me feel so empowered! It was like learning to unlock avatar
state[^avatar].

Finishing the days with the sensation of progress is invaluable. It motivates
you! It keeps you moving forward on this world surrounded by noise.

I hope that you start having intention on your days!
